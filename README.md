Multi-Agent RL for the Wolf-Sheep Game

## Game Description
In the figure below, you can see how the GUI of the game looks like.

Each game is played by two players (P1 and P2) that play against each other. A player has to operate two agents: the sheep and the wolf.

The wolf's objective is to sabotage the other player, by removing food items and trying to catch the opposite player's sheep. The sheep's objective is to score as many points as possible by eating food items.

## Rules and Objective of the Game

### Rules:
Both, the wolf and the sheep have 5 movement options for each call:
1. move = MOVE_DOWN;
2. move = MOVE_UP;
3. move = MOVE_LEFT;
4. move = MOVE_RIGHT;
5. move = MOVE_NONE;

The **wolf** is allowed to **make a step for every second step of the sheep**. In other words the sheep can move twice as fast as the wolf.

- Wolves cannot step on squares occupied by the opponentâ€™s wolf (wolves block each other).
- Wolves cannot step on squares occupied by the sheep of the same player.
- Sheep cannot step on squares occupied by the wolf of the same player.
- Sheep cannot step on squares occupied by the opposite sheep.
- Neither the sheep nor the wolf can enter a square with a fence on.
- Neither the sheep nor the wolf can step on a square outside the map. Imagine the map is surrounded by fences.
- If the sheep steps on a food object the food object is consumed (removed from the map) and a score is awarded.
- If the wolf steps on a food object the food object gets removed but no score is awarded.

Each game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns or unless a sheep gets caught by the wolf, then the game ends immediately.

If the wolf of player1 catches the sheep of player2 the game ends immediately and player1 wins and is awarded ${\color{red}all &nbspthe&nbsp points}$ for the current run.

### Objectives:
**For the sheep**:
- Avoid the wolf of the opposite player.
- Maximize points, by consuming as many food objects as possible.
  - The rhubarb object gives you **five** score points
  - The grass object gives you **one** score point

**For the wolf**:
- Catch the other player's sheep.
- Remove food objects to sabotage the other player.
- Block the other wolf.

## Project Setup
### Getting started
The code provided to you is written using Python version 3.7. The instructions given here will be to simply run the game and your code in the terminal. Alternatively, you can use an IDE of your choosing, for example PyCharm.

Make sure the relevant packages are installed on your computer (like arcade to run the graphics); in case they are not, you can install them, e.g. using pip/Anaconda/Honeybrew.

The **arcade** version used in this project is 2.0.0
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run the code
To run the code in the terminal, take the following steps:
