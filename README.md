Multi-Agent RL for the Wolf-Sheep Game

## Game Description
In the figure below, you can see how the GUI of the game looks like.

Each game is played by two players (P1 and P2) that play against each other. A player has to operate two agents: the sheep and the wolf.

The wolf's objective is to sabotage the other player, by removing food items and trying to catch the opposite player's sheep. The sheep's objective is to score as many points as possible by eating food items.
